Where the mind is without fear
by Rabindranath Tagore

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow dmestic walls
where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my father, let my country awake.
